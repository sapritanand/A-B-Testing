# A-B-Testing

<p>
 <h1> A/B Testing Data Analytics Project
<h2>Overview: 
This project is designed to perform A/B testing for analyzing the impact of different variations (A and B) on user behavior. By comparing two versions of a feature or design, we assess which performs better based on statistical analysis of collected data. The project leverages various data science techniques, including hypothesis testing, data visualization, and metrics evaluation.
<h2>
Features:</h2>
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare raw A/B test data for analysis.
Statistical Testing: Implement hypothesis testing using t-tests, z-tests, or non-parametric tests.
Performance Metrics: Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates, average revenue, etc.
Visualization: Graphical representation of test results (e.g., histograms, confidence intervals).
Reporting: Generate concise reports on the outcome of the A/B test, highlighting statistical significance and business impact.
